# GraffitiGazetteer

## Introduction
Ancient Egyptian interaction with places, buildings, and artefacts was reflected in the practice of secondary epigraphy (graffiti for short). Short texts and images, some outwardly resembling modern ‘tags’ and others more like ‘street art’, appeared in the funerary environment, or on temple architecture. They share features with rock inscriptions and rock art, such as select phraseology or functions. These seemingly unprepossessing artefacts are in fact eloquent traces of ancient societies and cultures, allowing fragmentary insights into both elite and non-elite lives and the roles that monuments continued to play in both of these long after their original construction. Their study has benefited from using concepts developed in anthropology, cultural history, literacy studies and cognitive archaeology, offering a rich interpretation. 

The ‘Graffiti gazetteer’ conversion grant aims to test conversion of select research data from Egypt followed by an investigation of new approaches to analyse these data in a micro-project exploring a potential research infrastructure. The project reconnoitres structure and functions intended to collate existing data on graffiti inn order to establish a way of integrating Egyptian data in the FAIR Epigraphy framework (https://ontology.inscriptiones.org/type_of_inscription/), developed in Classics, whilst respecting the current development of thesauri and ontology used for the description of ancient Egyptian resources included in the Thoth project (https://thot.philo.ulg.ac.be/index.html). 

The gazetteer data also include identifiers from other existing projects that map Egyptian written and archaeological resources: these projects include converted digital and born digital infrastructures, such as the Online Egyptological Bibliography, Topographical Bibliography (a.k.a. Porter/Moss), Trismegistos, and others.
