                    <h2>About the Gazetteer</h2>
                    <p class="lead">The Graffiti Inscription Gazetteer is a digital archive dedicated to cataloguing and
                        preserving the stories of graffiti inscriptions across Egypt. Explore locations, the stories
                        behind the inscriptions, and the writers, visitors, and artists who created them. The Graffiti
                        Gazetteer project builds a unique resource collecting data on the multilingual corpus of
                        graffiti in Egypt. In a full version, it aims to include historical secondary inscriptions
                        starting with ancient material but with potential to include visitors’ texts produced up until
                        the 20th century. </p>
                    <p>
                        <b>Its first aim is the ancient graffiti.</b> Secondary epigraphy, or graffiti, are probably the
                        most widespread media of the ancient world. Texts and figures added to varied surfaces and
                        places could be produced by nearly everyone. Even though graffiti articulated individual and
                        community concerns and religious and political views, they are underrated. This is a paradox,
                        because studying graffiti enriches historical knowledge and challenges established narratives
                        about past cultures.

                        <b>Why a digital resource for graffiti in Egypt and in the Nile Valley?</b> - Short texts and
                        images, some outwardly resembling modern ‘tags’ and others more like ‘street art’, appeared in
                        the funerary environment, or on temple architecture, as well as in other anthropogenic locations
                        like mines and quarries. These seemingly unprepossessing artefacts are in fact eloquent traces
                        of past societies and cultures, allowing fragmentary insights into both elite and non-elite
                        lives and the roles that monuments continued to play long after their original construction. The
                        graffiti study has benefited from using concepts developed in anthropology, cultural history,
                        literacy studies and cognitive archaeology, offering a rich interpretation.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Empowering research by digital data accessibility has changed the research of graffiti, as it
                        has been demonstrated by presentation of graffiti from single sites. Graffiti are a widespread,
                        productive source, but require both a quantitative and qualitative study that situates each
                        inscription in their environment, yet allows to view aggregated corpora in buildings, and across
                        sites or regions, and across historical periods. Egypt offers a fascinating corpus of texts and
                        images that provides insights including–and extending beyond–local or regional histories.
